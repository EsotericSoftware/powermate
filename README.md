# PowerMate

This is a small Windows utility that uses [libusbjava](http://libusbjava.sourceforge.net) to communicate with a Griffin PowerMate, which is a USB knob. When the knob is turned, the Windows master volume is adjusted. The LED brightness indicates the volume level, then fades away after a short time. Griffin's software supports controlling volume, but the LED stays on which was unacceptable for me.

This Java project can easily be extended to have the PowerMate knob perform other actions.
